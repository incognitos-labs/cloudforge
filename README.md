# CloudForge

**Cloud and Production Infrastructure**

A production-ready infrastructure platform that teaches you to think like an SRE. Build, deploy, monitor, and operate cloud-native applications with confidence.

## Overview

CloudForge provides a complete DevOps workflow that mirrors real-world production environments. From code push to deployment, monitoring, and incident response—experience the full lifecycle of cloud-native operations.

## The Workflow

```
You push code →
tests run →
containers build →
deployments roll out →
metrics light up →
alerts fire →
you respond.
```

Your other projects run on top of this infrastructure. When something breaks:

- **Logs tell you why**
- **Dashboards tell you where**

## What You'll Learn

### Production Thinking
Develop the mindset needed to build and operate reliable systems at scale. Learn to anticipate failure modes, design for resilience, and make data-driven decisions.

### Reliability Engineering
Master the principles of SRE: error budgets, SLIs/SLOs, toil reduction, and incident response. Build systems that are both reliable and maintainable.

### Cloud-Native Operations
Get hands-on experience with container orchestration, service mesh, observability, and infrastructure as code. Understand how modern cloud platforms operate.

## Mental Model

**"You are your own SRE team."**

CloudForge empowers you to own the entire stack—from infrastructure to application code. Learn to operate production systems independently, make informed decisions, and build reliable services.
