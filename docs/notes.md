22/12/2025 - Docker

Workspaces are used to isolate processes. Workspaces are seemingly a Linux native feature which helps containers to compartmentalize processes such that each process exist independently and one process has no idea what the other does. There are a couple of Linux Workspaces types that Docker uses, including the Processes, Network, Hostnames, and so on

cgroups however, dictate, allocate or define the resources extent of each individual workspace. cgroups define the memory, cpu allocations and so on.
